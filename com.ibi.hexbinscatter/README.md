	"properties": {
		"circles": {

		}
	}

## Data Buckets

### Measures:

* **X Axis (MES)** - used to set a horizontal position of data point on a chart.

* **Y Axis (MES)** - used to set a vertical position of data point on a chart.

* **Aggregate Value (MES)** - by default we count a number of circles in a bin to build bin's color scale, but if you drag a measure to this bucket, then values of all data points in a bucket will be summed up and used to build bin's color scale.

### Dimensions:

* **Detail (DIM)** - break data set by category ( if has no dimension, WebFocus just sums up all the values ).
