## Data Buckets

### Measures:
* **Size** - sets value of circle quantitative dimension ( radius ).
* **Sort** - enables you to sort by measures (ex. if you sort and size by country, all the larger circles will be closer to the middle).

### Dimensions:
* **Levels Bucket** - dragging dimensions to this bucket creates new levels.

* **Value Bucket** - values in this bucket are used to build a color scale and then color a node according to that colors scale.
